In this folder, there are two python scripts:
1. frames - The purpose of this script is to extract images from a video file. 
2. DatasetSplitter - The purpose of this script is to randomly select images and move it to another folder. This ensures that test and train dataset are created randomly. 

The practical application of this section is to extract images from a video so that it can be later fed into the model to be predicted for 
fire and non-fire images.
